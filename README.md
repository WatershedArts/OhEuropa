## Oh Europa

### Introduction
Is one of the 2017 Artist in Residence projects by Action Hero.

Simply put Action Hero would record audio in Europe upload it to a special server which then interfaces with Radio.co.

In the Oh Europa Client Application they would create beacon zones, which the iOS and Android Applications would collect.

When participants who had downloaded the application entered the beacon zone they would be able to listen into a special radio station that broadcasts the collected audio from Action Heroes Journey. 

More details can be found on their site. 

This page will detail some of the systems used to help create the project.
